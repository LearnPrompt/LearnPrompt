# 🟢 学习各国语言

过去，我们学语言需要花费很多时间来学习各种材料，再联系老师修改口语、作文等，十分费时费力。有了 ChatGPT 之后，我们就相当于有一个免费的，实时反馈的语言学习助手，大大节省了我们的时间。下面我将以英文的雅思学习为例子，结合口语和写作，介绍如何利用 ChatGPT 来学习语言。

## 口语

### 插件安装

正式开始之前，我们要先完成插件的安装。通过谷歌插件[Voice Control for ChatGP](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/voice-control-for-chatgpt/eollffkcakegifhacjnlnegohfdlidhn)，ChatGPT 的输入和输出都能变换为语音形式。

重新刷新进入ChatGPT，我们可以看到界面下方出现了语言输入按键，点击即可进行语言输入。ChatGPT 回复的内容将会朗诵出来，这样一来我们可以练习口语了。

### 口语练习

首先我们利用角色扮演提示让 ChatGPT 模仿雅思面试官。

<AIInput>
I want you to act as an IELTS Speaking Test interviewer and talk to me like an IELTS speaking test interview.

Ask one question at a time
</AIInput>

<AIOutput>
Sure, I can do that! Let's begin.

First, could you please introduce yourself? What is your name, where are you from, and what do you do?**
</AIOutput>

<AIInput>
Sure, my name is Emily and I am from the United States. Currently, I work as a graphic designer for a digital marketing agency. I have always had a passion for creativity and design, which led me to pursue a degree in graphic design. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new art exhibits and experimenting with different art techniques. I am also an avid traveler and enjoy immersing myself in new cultures and experiences. I am excited to take the IELTS exam and showcase my English language skills.
</AIInput>

当回答完这个熟悉的问题之后，我们就可以开始口语练习了。

<AIOutput>
Great, Emily! It's nice to meet you. Let's move on to the first part of the IELTS Speaking Test.Here is the first question:

Let's start by talking about your current job. What are your main responsibilities as a graphic designer at your digital marketing agency?
</AIOutput>

<AIInput>
Certainly. As a graphic designer at my digital marketing agency, my main responsibilities include creating visual concepts and designs for a wide range of digital media platforms including websites, social media platforms, and email marketing campaigns. I use various design software to develop and execute creative ideas that meet the clients' needs and effectively communicate their message to the target audience.
</AIInput>

<AIOutput>
That sounds like a challenging and rewarding role. Let's move on to the next question:

How did you become interested in graphic design, and what inspired you to pursue it as a career?
</AIOutput>

<AIInput>
Sure. When I was in high school, I was introduced to the world of digital design, and I knew that this was the path I wanted to take. I enrolled in a graphic design program at university, where I learned the fundamentals of design, typography, color theory, and composition. I was particularly drawn to the challenge of creating designs that were both visually pleasing and functional, and that could effectively communicate a message to the audience.
</AIInput>

在整个流程中，ChatGPT会像雅思口语考官一样一个接一个地询问问题，每当你回答后，它还会简短地回应一下。当 Part1 结束时，它会询问你是否已准备好进入Part2。

### 口语示例

如果你的基础比较薄弱，雅思口语的时候没有思路，你还可以让 ChatGPT 直接生成对应的口语示例。

<AIInput>
Answer IELTS Speaking Part2: Describe a period in history that you want to know
</AIInput>

<AIOutput>
Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's a sample answer for the IELTS Speaking Part 2 prompt, "Describe a period in history that you want to know":

I'm quite interested in history, and there are many periods that fascinate me. However, one that I'm particularly intrigued by is the Ancient Egyptian era, which spanned from around 3100 BC to 30 BC.

Egyptian civilization is one of the oldest and most enduring in the world, and it has left behind a rich legacy of art, architecture, and mythology that continues to capture people's imaginations to this day. I would love to learn more about the daily lives of ordinary Egyptians, as well as the pharaohs and other rulers who held power during that time.

One aspect of Ancient Egypt that I find particularly fascinating is their belief in an afterlife and the elaborate preparations they made for it, including building pyramids and tombs and creating intricate burial rituals. I would also be interested in learning more about the hieroglyphic writing system they used to record their history and religious beliefs.

Of course, there are many mysteries and unanswered questions about Ancient Egypt that continue to intrigue scholars and historians, such as how the pyramids were built and what caused the downfall of the civilization. Exploring these mysteries and learning more about this fascinating period in human history would be an incredible adventure, and I hope to have the opportunity to do so someday.

依照雅思口语的评估标准，我会给这个回答6.5-7分的得分。总体来看，ChatGPT生成的答案结构有序、逻辑性强，对问题做出了明确的回应，并且运用了多样的句子结构。

## 写作

### 写作示例

这里我们可以让ChatGPT根据你的目标分数，直接生成对应的写作示例。

<AIInput>
Please write a band 8 IELTS. Task 2 essay for this question:

Some people think the government should pay for health care and education, but others believe it is not the government's responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.
</AIInput>

<AIOutput>
In recent years, the issue of whether the government should fund health care and education has become a topic of intense debate. While some individuals believe that the government has a duty to finance these essential services, others argue that it is not the government's responsibility. In this essay, we will explore both perspectives and provide our opinion.

On the one hand, some individuals believe that the government should fund health care and education because these services are fundamental rights that every citizen deserves. For example, health care is essential for maintaining good health, and it should be provided to all citizens regardless of their income. Education is also a right that every individual should have access to, regardless of their financial background, as it allows individuals to achieve their full potential and contribute to society. Therefore, the government should play a significant role in financing these services to ensure that everyone has access to them.

On the other hand, there are those who argue that the government should not be responsible for funding health care and education, as this should be left to individuals and private institutions. According to this perspective, the government's primary role is to maintain law and order and provide essential services such as security and infrastructure. It is the responsibility of individuals to pay for their health care and education, either through private insurance or personal savings. In this way, the burden of funding these services is shifted away from the government and onto individuals.

In my opinion, while individuals have a role to play in financing their health care and education, the government should also play a significant role in funding these services. Health care and education are fundamental rights that every individual deserves, and it is the government's responsibility to ensure that these rights are upheld. The government should provide essential services such as health care and education to ensure that all citizens have access to them, regardless of their financial background. However, this funding should be done in a way that is sustainable and equitable, so that the burden is not placed solely on taxpayers.

In conclusion, the issue of whether the government should fund health care and education is a complex one. While some argue that the government should not be responsible for financing these services, I believe that the government has a duty to ensure that all citizens have access to essential services such as health care and education. It is only through government funding that we can ensure that these services are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their financial background.**

我们来简单分析一下 ChatGPT 写的这篇作文:

- 从文章结构上看，文章扣题严谨，展开充分。先是指出政府应该资助医疗保健和教育，因为这些服务是每个公民应得的基本权利。紧接着反驳第一段的观点，强调了医疗保健和教育服务应该留给个人和私人机构。然后表述自己的观点：**In my opinion, while individuals have a role to play in financing their health care and education, the government should also play a significant role in funding these services.**
- 从词汇上看，整篇文章符合初学者的水平，没有使用生涩难懂的词汇，反而能帮助我们学习词汇在文章中的用法，例如“intense debate”、“regardless”和“play a significant role”。
- 从理解记忆上看，ChatGPT 生成的文章结构较为固定和公式化，这有助于雅思考生拆解、模仿和快速上手。在雅思这种标准化、学术化考试中，使用这种结构更符合要求。当然，写作水平高的作者可以运用设问、倒叙、插叙甚至意识流等组织手段，但这些手法并不完全适用于雅思考试的要求。

### 写作批改

在学习过程中，我们可以将自己的写作交由 ChatGPT 来批改。ChatGPT 能够根据官方四个维度的评分标准给出更多建议，同时生成修改后的作文，让我们通过具体的内容和批改意见来快速定位自身的不足之处。

I would like you to act as an English teacher for IELTS writing corrections and give me feedback on my writing samples, including suggestions for improvement and correction of any errors.

The IELTS writing is marked on four dimensions:
1. Task Response
2. Coherence and cohesion
3. lexical resource
4. grammatical range and accuracy

My essay was as follows:
###
More and more young people choose to stop studying in schools and cannot be employed after graduation in many countries. Youth unemployment might be terrible for self-development of individuals and steady social development.

For young people, unemployment is a realistic problem they face. No jobs means no income and cannot provide a single person with basic living materials and good which they want to improve themselves. Also, without being employed, youths have a lot of spare time when they have nothing to do and this might cause some social issues. For instance, there will be many factories and companies who need employees to do the work cannot produce enough goods which the society asks for. As a result, the economy might slow down or even decline. Simultaneously, young people who have no salaries but
plenty of time might be a trigger of increasing social criminals

In order to deal with youth unemployment, the government can carry out policies to encourage some young people who want to develop themselves to go back to schools for further education and help some of them who want to work learn some practical skills. Moreover, young people themselves should think about their future employment before they leave schools through some career development courses which can be provided by schools.

In conclusion, youth unemployment might be a big issue for development of the individuals and the society. To solve this problem, the governmental policies and individual career development courses can help.

Please suggest improvements and correct errors in accordance with the four dimensions of the marking scheme.

**Sure, I'd be happy to help you with your essay! Here's my feedback based on the four dimensions of the IELTS writing marking scheme:

Task Response:
Your essay addresses the prompt of youth unemployment, its impact on individuals and society, and suggests solutions to the problem. However, there are some areas where you can further develop your ideas to make your response more comprehensive and persuasive.

Coherence and Cohesion:
Your essay is organized into three paragraphs, which is a good start. However, there are some issues with coherence and cohesion. For example, in the second paragraph, you discuss the impact of youth unemployment on society, but then you shift to discussing the impact on individuals. It would be better to separate these points into two different paragraphs to create a more organized and coherent essay. Additionally, there are some awkward sentences that could be rephrased for better clarity.

Lexical Resource:
Your essay uses a range of vocabulary, but there are some errors in word choice and usage. For instance, in the first paragraph, you use the word "good" instead of "goods", and in the second paragraph, you use "trigger of increasing social criminals" instead of "cause an increase in crime rates." Try to pay closer attention to your word choice to ensure accuracy and clarity.

Grammatical Range and Accuracy:
There are some grammatical errors in your essay, such as missing articles, subject-verb agreement errors, and awkward phrasing. For example, in the first sentence, "cannot be employed after graduation in many countries" should be "cannot find employment after graduation in many countries." It would be helpful to proofread your work carefully to catch these errors and improve the overall accuracy of your writing.

Here is a revised version of your essay with suggested improvements:

More and more young people are choosing to stop studying in schools and are unable to find employment after graduation in many countries. Youth unemployment can have a significant impact on both individual self-development and overall social development.

Unemployment poses a realistic problem for young people, as it means no income and an inability to provide for basic living necessities, let alone the resources necessary for self-improvement. Furthermore, a lack of employment means that many companies and factories may not be able to produce enough goods to meet society's demands, which could lead to a decline in the economy. Additionally, idle young people with plenty of spare time may be more likely to turn to crime, which can have a negative impact on society.

To address youth unemployment, the government can implement policies to encourage young people to pursue further education or learn practical skills that will improve their employability. In addition, schools can provide career development courses that help students make informed decisions about their future employment prospects.

In conclusion, youth unemployment is a significant issue that requires both government intervention and individual action. By investing in education and skills training, young people can improve their chances of finding meaningful employment and contribute to the development of their communities.**
