# Contribute

This site is **open source** and contributions are extremely welcome. 
You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/LearnPrompt/LearnPrompt),
along with many [open issues](https://github.com/LearnPrompt/LearnPrompt/issues). 
If you want to get involved, but don't know how, reach out to learnprompt2023@gmail.com and I will help you get started.

In particular, we are looking for help with:

## 1. Site design and layout

We have a number of open issues on ease of use feature for the site.

## 2. Content

We are continually seeking to expand our content on artificial intelligence (AI), ranging from new research papers to more anecdotal discussions. 

Whether you have insights from recent papers, personal stories, product recommendations, or applications of AI in research, your contributions are valuable. 

For ideas on content that we are still looking to cover, you can check our open issues. If you have something to share or suggest, please contribute by making a PR. We are especially interested in content that applies AI prompting techniques in innovative ways.

## 3. Translation

We are looking for help translating the site into other languages. If you are interested, please join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/zBsQyq7MHA) and mention you are interested in the respective language channel. If the channel does not exist, please message @ carl@aiwarts. Around 2 languages are currently being translated, so you will likely find people to work with! 

:::note
When you run the website locally, make sure to follow [Docusaurus instructions](https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/tutorial#start-your-site) on running it in your language (e.g. `npm run start -- --locale fr`).

## 4. Miscl.

Everything from fixing typos to recommendations for the site (suggest papers, 
layout changes, tell us what you want to learn about, etc.)

We need help maintaining the list of prompt engineering tools and products that use prompting.
