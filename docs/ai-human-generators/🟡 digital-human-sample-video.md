## Shooting Content

The video length should be 3 to 5 minutes.

Notes:

1. The motion capture period is the **first minute of the video (excluding the first 5 seconds)**, so the actions during this period should be rich and diverse.
2. To accommodate future content expressions, it is recommended to perform some generic actions (such as **shaking hands, spreading both hands, extending forward**), and avoid overly specific gestures (like raising 3 fingers).

## Preparation

| Phone/Camera | The higher the resolution, the better, both front and back cameras are acceptable |
| --- | --- |
| Phone Stand | Secure the phone to ensure the video remains steady during shooting |
| Camera App | Recommended to use "Beauty Camera" (the app name is exactly this) as it offers high-definition filming, one-click beautification, and teleprompter features. Membership costs 12 yuan. |
| Scene Selection | Choose a location with good lighting (no shadows in the frame), nice background, and quiet environment (select a background related to your theme, or one your audience may like. If unsure, refer to competitor accounts or peers.) |
| Charming/Handsome You | Maintain your best state, consider attire, hairstyle, makeup, and mental state (for more professional and clear photography results, consider removing accessories and ornaments before shooting.) |
| Script Preparation | Prepare the script in advance to ensure ease of recording while focusing on the camera |

### Script Autogeneration

1. With the help of a domestic GPT site [https://aiwarts-mj-gpt.zeabur.app/#/chat](https://aiwarts-mj-gpt.zeabur.app/#/chat), you can enter the following prompt and directly obtain the text you need for recording.

Example:

- **Generate a calming style reading text about digital humans, with a word count between 900 and 1000, suitable for relaxed reading**

| Script Example | Hello everyone! I'm xxx, and this is my digital avatar, recorded with Carl's assistance. Today, I want to talk about digital humans, those virtual entities based on code and algorithms. Digital humans are a product of modern technology and play an increasingly important role in our lives.

First, let's look at the definition of digital humans. Digital humans are virtual entities with artificial intelligence at their core, capable of simulating human thought and behavior. They can think, learn, and communicate like us, but they do not possess physical bodies. The advent of digital humans has brought us many conveniences and opportunities, as well as sparked some discussions and controversies.

Some worry that digital humans might replace humans, becoming our competitors. However, I believe such concerns are unnecessary. Digital humans are not meant to replace us but to assist us. They can handle large amounts of data and information, offering intelligent solutions. They help us manage tedious tasks, freeing our time and energy to focus on more creative and valuable activities.

Digital humans have a wide range of applications. In the medical field, they can assist doctors in diagnostics and treatment, providing personalized medical plans. In education, they can be learning partners for students, offering personalized learning schedules and guidance. In business, they can help companies analyze markets and predict trends, providing support for strategic decisions. In entertainment, they can become virtual characters, accompanying us through enjoyable times.

However, digital humans also raise some ethical and moral questions. For instance, should digital humans have rights and privacy? How can we ensure that their actions comply with ethical and legal standards? These are issues we need to carefully consider and explore. We need to establish a set of reasonable rules and guidelines to ensure the development and application of digital humans align with societal interests and values.

Despite the opportunities and challenges brought by digital humans, we should not fear them. We should approach their development with a peaceful mindset and fully utilize their advantages. Digital humans are extensions of our intelligence and creativity, helping us address many real-world problems.

Lastly, I want to emphasize that no matter how digital humans evolve, human values and dignity are always paramount. Digital humans are merely tools and aides; we remain the main actors and decision-makers in society. We should maintain control and oversight over digital humans to ensure they do not negatively impact our lives. |

Friendly Tips:

1. For better results, it is advisable to shoot 5 to 10 times and then choose the best one to send to the service provider.

## Start Shooting

### 6.1 Standards for High-Quality Sample Videos

**Important‼️**

| Background/Scene | Choose a location with good lighting, a nice background, and a quiet environment (select a scene related to your content theme or one your audience may like. If unsure, refer to competitor accounts or peers.) |
| --- | --- |
| State | Be relaxed and natural, imagine sharing knowledge with a friend you're familiar with |
| Eye Contact | Please keep your eyes on the phone screen at all times, imagining the phone as your friend (the phone is actually the viewer's perspective; if you look elsewhere, it will be noticeable). Caution⚠️: Rolling your eyes or having an unfocused gaze will be very apparent |
| Expression | Try to maintain a smile or a relaxed state (your audience will appreciate it), and after finishing a sentence, pause for a moment (1~2 seconds) and close your mouth |
| Posture | It is recommended to choose sitting or standing positions: for standing, ensure the frame is above the waist to capture hand movements; sitting can be from waist up or full body |
| Movements | Stay active, move your hands every 5~10 seconds to make the viewing more dynamic, but note: 1) The speed of movements should not be too fast; 2) The height should not exceed the neck; 3) Use some generic movements, such as one or both hands spread out |
| Voice | Maintain the normal pace and emphasis of your speech, there's no need to be overly deliberate, as this would make the clone's voice sound less like you |

### 6.2 Precautions

1. Shooting Duration: At least a **3 to 5-minute** uninterrupted speech video.
2. Expressions and Movements: The motion capture period is the **first minute of the video (excluding the first 5 seconds)**, so the actions during this period should be rich and diverse.
3. Video Content: You can talk about something you like, such as an introduction to yourself, your work, or what you intend to do with digital humans. You don't need to strictly follow reference videos; gestures can be more varied, such as shaking hands, spreading both hands, extending forward.
4. Forgetting Lines: **If you forget your lines, it's okay, just keep talking**; you can introduce yourself.
5. Starting: When beginning the video recording, **stay still for the first 5 seconds**, then start speaking.
