# OpenAI Cuts Prices by 50%: My Experience with 10 "High-End" AI Applications (Part 2)

Picking up where we left off,

**OpenAI Cuts Prices by 50%: My Experience with 10 "High-End" AI Applications (Part 1)**

This article brings you even more valuable tools.

How did you find the five tools recommended in the last article? How was your experience?

In this part, we'll continue to explore how to fully leverage low-cost APIs.

From academia, translation, agents, knowledge graphs, and even supercharging your virtual assistant‚ÄîI've got you covered!

With the cost-effective GPT-4o mini, you can dive right in without hesitation!

### GPT Academic 6/10

As a content creator aiming for daily updates, producing a large volume of content is like feeding a token-hungry beast.

Especially when writing involves in-depth research, the token consumption skyrockets.

**ChatGPT Academic** is a ChatGPT application specifically designed for academic work.

It‚Äôs incredibly powerful!

![GPT Academic Features](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/donttal/imgbed/img/640-20240821225920832)

It‚Äôs a one-stop service for all your research needs: proofreading, translation, code interpretation, and it even supports Mermaid diagram rendering.

**Writing Assistance**

GPT Academic can help you correct grammar errors and polish your writing.

![Editing Example](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/donttal/imgbed/img/640-20240821225933074)

It doesn't just correct your text; it presents the corrections in a table, listing each sentence with the suggested changes and the reasoning behind them.

It also handles LaTeX-formatted equations effortlessly.

**Direct Code Reading**

Too lazy to read project code? Just throw the entire project at ChatGPT.

Six months ago, during the GPT-4 API era, I wouldn‚Äôt have dared to use such a feature.

**LaTeX/Arxiv Paper Translation**

GPT Academic can even help you with paper translations. Simply input the Arxiv article link, and it translates it directly!

**Mermaid-Based Diagrams and Mind Maps for Papers**

In short, this project that had been gathering dust on my computer has been revived.

### Immersive Translation 7/10

As mentioned earlier, paper translation is crucial, but we often need to read a lot of web content daily.

**Immersive Translation** is arguably the best plugin for web translation optimization!

![Immersive Translation Interface](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/donttal/imgbed/img/640-20240821230128055)

The best part? It provides bilingual translation!

![Bilingual Example](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/donttal/imgbed/img/640-20240821230136940)

It also supports video subtitles and PDF translations.

If you want a better translation experience, using a large model as the translation engine is necessary. But as you can imagine, the token consumption is significant‚Äîover a thousand tokens per webpage, and reading dozens of pages daily is inevitable.

But with 4o mini, there's nothing to fear.

Next up are two top-tier applications: MemGPT and GraphRAG.

### Long-Term Memory and Custom Tool Agent - MemGPT 8/10

MemGPT became a hit by introducing a novel idea: turning large language models into operating systems, creating an experience of infinite context!

![MemGPT Interface](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/donttal/imgbed/img/640-20240821230153166)

When I tried MemGPT for a week, I hardly ever created new conversations.

The model could always remember what I wanted.

At the time, memory management, memory compression, and other operations all required API integration.

This high-priced tool gathered dust on my computer.

Now, I've brought it back as my long-term task chatbot.

No need to repeatedly start new conversations or upload your files into GPTs‚Äîit's a seamless experience.

The key project information in this article was summarized with the help of MemGPT. üëç

### Enterprise-Level Knowledge Graph - GraphRAG 9/10

GraphRAG has been on fire lately! It's a project that RAG enthusiasts shouldn‚Äôt miss.

It‚Äôs hailed as the next generation of RAG! When it was open-sourced last month, people complained that the cost of building graphs was too high for the average person. üòÇ

You‚Äôve probably heard of RAG, a technique that combines information retrieval and text generation to significantly improve the accuracy and relevance of generated content, widely used in intelligent Q&A and content generation.

![GraphRAG Interface](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/donttal/imgbed/img/640-20240821230204523)

It partially solves the problem of limited context length in large models while also preventing hallucinations.

Unlike standard RAG, which relies on vector similarity for information retrieval, GraphRAG uses large language models (LLMs) to construct knowledge graphs from unstructured text. This graph-based approach allows for a more structured and comprehensive understanding of data, supporting both local and global query responses.

### Supercharging Xiao Ai with MiGPT 10/10

![MiGPT Interface](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/donttal/imgbed/img/640-20240821230232636)

Many of you who love tinkering may have already equipped your home with smart devices!

You might use Xiao Ai for tasks like turning lights on and off.

Sometimes, when you're bored, you might even ask Xiao Ai to chat with you. ü§£

Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if Xiao Ai could be as "understanding" as GPT?

MiGPT lets you supercharge Xiao Ai!

![MiGPT Example](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/donttal/imgbed/img/640-20240821230244196)

You can even use Doubao to customize its voice!

Transform, Xiao Ai! (Haha)

It‚Äôs almost like having your personal language tutor‚ÄîXiao Ai helps me practice my spoken language!

### Final Thoughts

These ten projects are currently the ones I use most frequently.

I look forward to discovering more new and exciting "high-end" projects.

Stay tuned for more updates in this series! (Feel free to share your discoveries)

The improved cost-effectiveness of APIs is making more products and tools practically usable.

Who knows, in a while, we might achieve GPT API freedom on mobile devices before Apple's AI updates.
